####mpvbd

This is a bash script to play blurays with mpv by passing the path of the bluray location.  
The path can be the main path to the bluray or any folder/file within the BDMV or CERTIFICATE folders.
The intention of this script is to be used with a file manager like Dolphin, associating .m2ts or .bdmv files.

Examples:  
`mpvbd /media/bluraydrive/`  
`mpvbd /media/bluraydrive/BDMV/index.bdmv`
